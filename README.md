## 💡 Inspiration
> _"There is hope, even when your brain cells tell there isn't"_ <br>
> _"You don't have to be great to start, but you should start to be great"_

- These two quotes alongwith the exponential rise in the Mental Health, anxiety, depression cases (even Post COVID) - our team [[Hariket](https://github.com/hariketsheth), [Zac](https://github.com/dragochar)] decided to work on a Mental Health App that does give users options to track their day-to-day activities. 
- Since the mental health issues are increasing at an exponential rate, we got motivated to build an application which is relief to such people. 
- Without having this information getting spread or broadcasted thereby maintaining complete user privacy.
